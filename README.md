# Coursera - Google Data Analytics Capstone Project


## Introduction:

Bellabeat is a US wearable tech producer and brand based in San Francisco, California. With their holistic approach their products are designed to motivate and guide women to better health.Their team believes that analyzing smart device fitness data could help unlock new growth opportunities for the company. As a result, they have asked the following:

- What are some trends in smart device usage?
- How could these trends apply to Bellabeat customers?
- How could these trends help influence Bellabeat marketing strategy?



## Business Objective:
Analyze popular smart device user habits and trends to expand their market strategy


## Data used:

For the purpose of this analysis I'll be using **FitBit Fitness Tracker Public Dataset** ( https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arashnic/fitbit.) 

**Data Reliability:**

- Data is from 2016 meaning due to its age it may not be relevant and reliable anymore
- The data was collected from 30 users only, whereas according to a quick google search the current estimate of active Fitbit users is of 31million people indicating that the sample only accounts for 0.000096% of the total population. For a confidence level of 95% and a margin of error of +/- 5% the size of the sample for the given population should be of 385, i.e an additional 355 user data is needed.
- According to the case study information, BellaBeat operates worldwide, however this dataset does not include where the users are from (their location could affect their behaviour hence have an effect on the data).
- Overall the data seems to be reliable in the sense that is truthful, original and comprehensive, however it has serious issues with currency, relevance and accuracy in depicting the population as a whole. My recommendation would be to either use a different dataset with more data, or take the time to undergo another survey to collect more data.
