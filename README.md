Preparing Data for Analysis
For this project, I've used the 18 datasets dated from 03/12/2016 - 05/12/2016 provided on kaggle. Click on this FitBit Fitness Tracker Data (CC0: Public Domain, dataset made available through Mobius) to access the website and download the datasets provided as .csv files. This data set contains personal fitness data from 30 fitbit users on minute-level output for physical activity, heart rate, and sleep monitoring. It also includes information on daily activity, steps, and heart rate that can be used to explore users’ habits. Thirty Fitbit users consented to the submission of personal tracker data and the data provided in this website is made available to access to the public.

Or you could access and download the data from this repository named as "Raw Data".

I am using Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio in this part of the project to help process and analyze the datasets.

First make sure to import all of the dataset as a .csv file to the database server. In order to solve this business task, only 6 of the given 18 datasets was used. Many of the files are either redundant, is not essential, or relevant, or lacking sufficient data to perform an analysis upon.
